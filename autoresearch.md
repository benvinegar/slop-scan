# Autoresearch: scanner throughput

## Objective
Improve the throughput of the repository scanner without changing its fundamental architecture, feature set, or observable behavior.

This loop is strictly about pure scan performance. Keep the same rules, outputs, and semantics. Avoid benchmark-specific hacks and do not special-case particular repositories, file names, or paths.

## Metrics
- **Primary**: `total_ms` (ms, lower is better) — summed `analyzeRepository()` time across a representative cached workload.
- **Secondary**: `total_files`, `total_findings`, `total_score`, plus per-repo `SCAN ...` timings printed by the benchmark script.

## How to Run
- `./autoresearch.sh`
- Checks: `./autoresearch.checks.sh`

The benchmark workload scans these cached repos in sequence:
1. `benchmarks/.cache/checkouts/known-ai-vs-solid-oss/agent-ci`
2. `benchmarks/.cache/checkouts/known-ai-vs-solid-oss/umami`
3. `benchmarks/.cache/checkouts/known-ai-vs-solid-oss/astro`
4. `benchmarks/.cache/checkouts/known-ai-vs-solid-oss/openclaw`

This mix covers small, medium, large, and very large JS/TS repositories so we do not overfit to a single codebase.

## Files in Scope
- `src/core/engine.ts` — scan pipeline orchestration
- `src/discovery/walk.ts` — filesystem traversal and ignore matching
- `src/core/fact-store.ts` — runtime fact storage
- `src/facts/*.ts` — fact extraction hot paths
- `src/default-registry.ts` — provider/rule registration if needed for performance-neutral cleanup
- `src/reporters/*.ts` — only if needed for performance without changing output
- `tests/**/*.ts` — regression coverage for behavior-preserving refactors
- `scripts/autoresearch-throughput.ts` — benchmark harness

## Off Limits
- Rule semantics, thresholds, severities, or scoring behavior
- Reporter content/format behavior
- Benchmark manifests or pinned benchmark contents
- Repo-specific skip lists or hard-coded fast paths for benchmark repositories
- New runtime dependencies
- Large architectural rewrites

## Constraints
- Preserve the scanner's behavior and feature set.
- No cheating on the benchmark workload.
- No benchmark-only special casing.
- Keep the current architecture: discovery -> fact providers -> rules -> reporters.
- Any kept change must pass `./autoresearch.checks.sh`.

## What's Been Tried
- Baseline recorded at `total_ms=15205.371` over agent-ci, umami, astro, and openclaw.
- **Kept**: removed an extra `ts.createSourceFile()` from logical LOC counting and replaced `text.split(/\r?\n/)` with a zero-allocation physical line counter. This dropped the workload to `total_ms=10330.611` with unchanged `total_findings=3715` and `total_score=12412.12`.
- **Discarded**: precompiling ignore regexes and swapping `Array.find()` for a manual language loop in discovery made the workload slower on the benchmark mix.
- Initial likely hotspots still worth investigating:
  - repeated full-AST walks across multiple fact providers
  - avoid unnecessary AST position work in comment extraction
  - reduce repeated repo/file fact lookups in hot loops where it does not change behavior
